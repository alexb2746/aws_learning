# aws_learning
This will coincide with the udemy course for the AWS advanced networking speciality 
The specific Udemy course is here: https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-advanced-networking-specialty-ans
Instead of using the console, I will be using Terraform to create the labs and use the repoistory so I can reference them in the future
